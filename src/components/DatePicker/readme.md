# Date Picker

## Usage

“Do we need a datepicker?” [This article](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/07/maybe-you-dont-need-a-date-picker.html) lays out some common accessibility issues with datepicker, along with instructions for building an accessible, human-readable date input for when a datepicker is not essential to the user experience.

This component pulls in the Airbnb react dates library for when the app does need a datepicker. A few advantages for this library -

- Reasonable keyboard navigation that meets user expectations
- Comprehensive screen reader messages
- Support for internationalization
- Supports styles override
