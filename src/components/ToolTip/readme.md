# Tool Tip

## Usage

As we already established, tooltips are for clarification; they are for providing missing information. But why should that information be missing in the first place? Tooltips are a last resort, where space really is at a premium â€” perhaps due to the sheer number of controls, like in the toolbar for a WYSIWYG editor. - [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/)
